Test Success!! Add whatever you want about it too. Let me know if you need any help with the rich text editor, but don't forget to insert the image into the body as well, or you will get just the text when you click the blog post. But you can put images, different images, links, whatever in here. The wizzy-style rich text editor lets you bypass markdown entirely. Or you can swap to markdown if you prefer.
